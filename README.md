It's an indie game, baby.

## Repository Structure 
### Materials
Materials are textures for 3D objects. For us, these will likely be entirely textures for the ground.

### Scenes
Scenes (.tscn) are collections of nodes in Godot. The main game is a scene, but the player's camera, animations, and collison objects are bundled together in a scene that is added to the World scene.

### Scripts
GDScript code files.

### Sprites
2D sprites, for objects, characters, the player's animations, and GUI elements.
